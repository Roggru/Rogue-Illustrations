        I have walked for much of these lifetimes now. It is freeing, a liberating great, verdant sea that blankets and keeps to the starry dreams born. I sometimes fear wandering to unknown lands, of wondering uncreated thoughts. Nothing but more signs that point me onwards stops me. Yet—sometimes to submit to what winds guide me and what storms scare me—death is my reward. But a teratoid creature of far more marring lives in these lands; empty dreams it carries, I suppose, but surely filled with wandering. It is a comfort to know that what wonders lie here are for its hunger; that, perhaps in time will it never swallow me whole. Death and its other dealings seem to lie in the carrion of unscarred, uneaten animals. Though unseen: forgotten; safe, yet terrifyingly taken. I have never seen it. Nor do I suppose that this Reaper of Things concludes these bones and bodies to rest. What magic it is that by its bellows, something more than death fills into footprints in the earth. There is dread to deign not by what is eaten, but never will be. What is destined for death, but will never see it. I have walked across much of these lands now, there and back all over again—yet find nothing to the beauties that have scarred me. Nothing has harmed me. No pain can ever touch me. Death is the reward, and dying, the pleasure.

        These thoughts of mine bear no missives, but in good graces they live well; uneaten and unfounded. Seen, and always unforgotten. These are my natural laws that I abide by; this is the world that I bow to. To the terror of which I will never see—this Reaper of Things: I await above what last I have… comfortably; comfortably, until naught is left but bare and barren wonders.
