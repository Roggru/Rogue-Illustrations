        <p class="p2">"There is no past nor present that belongs to us. There is no future that is ours. There is no freedom in our living, nor the fickle thing of fate. 
        <br>Do you know why?"</p>

        <p class="passage">Among the supreme powers inhabiting the Unknown expanse of the high heavens, the god Axima Asahdi is a being enshrouded by mystery, shadow, and lost scriptures only known to a few studied, as well as a nomadic group of spiritualist hermits known as the Morai Canticle, or the ‘People Between’. Detailed from the journal of Serill Augustine, a studious wayfarer from the Academy of Mueradim, who documented the hermits: the Morai Canticle give no description of the god Axima Asahdi, whom they frequently name as ‘the Apex’, or ‘Hecate’, but recounts its capability and role within the Known expanse and World. It is an omnipresent being located within an external domain known only as the Greater Mind, and wields a dreadful control over the sway of time (although partially) and the estranged power of adjae, what the hermits regard as the power of mental confluence and control. Its influence, though intangible, is pervasive within the mind, suggesting a distinction between the physical and mental aspect of living, which the People Between culturally uphold and strengthen for that reason.</p>

        <p class="quote">They are a good people, if not bizarre from their myriad of traditions and rituals. What is most peculiar about them is their size, numbering only about fifty allows for unbelievable mobility across the territories and provinces. If needed, they are able to organize within the night, and are gone even before the morning. The guide responds to my speculatory question without asking—it is… about some alternate reality? No, not quite.
        <br>—Serill Augustine, gathering information about the Greater Mind</p>

        <p class="passage">The Greater Mind cannot be physically located, nor closed away by powers even wielded by other divines, but is speculated to spread its influence and sway within the capabilities of the soul via spirituality and Will. Aside from the god’s presence, the domain also contains dark shades, called Dancers (due to their fluid and bizarre way of moving), which frequently escape and intentionally cause harm to any living being within their proximity. It is unknown whether the Apex assumes a command over them, or (as told by the People Between) that they are servants which are eternally bound to the domain to both keep the Apex within it, and expand its influence among the intangible realm within the physical world. It occasionally emerges from a bridge or manifested entrance in physical space, an event that the Morai Canticle fiercely observes and traces through appointed members within a circle. As detailed, it is both a means to gain a better understanding of the veiled Axima Asahdi, and to prevent the Dancers that escape from the Greater Mind from causing irreparable harm.</p>

        <p class="passage">The people regard Axima Asahdi with great concern and sacred apprehension, as among its control over the intangible, they believe it has the power to give those it deems ‘worthy’ a longevity, or immortality. Though what worthiness entails is never agreed upon.</p>

        <p class="passage">This coincides with their posing of its true purpose: that the god gains sustenance or amusement through its endless nature of ‘watching’, or observing the universe and its entropic existence. It thrives from the misery of conflict, the burden of suffering, and the shadow of sorrow, and has some similarities to the Great Enemies that posed a threat against the Seven Ideals, the Vessel, and even their predecessors, Ae and Eir, leading some to claim its origin lies among them, or even predating them entirely.</p>

        <p class="passage">Along with this, there is a deep connection to Axima Asahdi and a theme of a soul-consuming nothingness which manifests as a ceaseless ennui. Among its eons of observation and confinement, it hungers, and even orchestrates catastrophes and calamities for all mortalkind, and especially for humankind. The Morai Canticle frequently describes the nature of cyclism: that all existence is bound to recurrence, circling onto itself to repeat what is, has, and will be—and that Axima Asahdi is the axis, or sole being responsible for all historical sorrows, and all inevitable tragedies.</p>

        <p class="passage">But to prevent the True End from occurring and the complete ruination of the cycle, it bestows to a single thing its gift of immortality; a witness, bound to the prosperity of beginnings, and the disparity of falls. It is this selected being which is anointed to a responsibility mistaken as salvation: to be the one remaining until the end becomes unshakable, and when it comes, to begin the world again. The People Between give this being the title ‘Forefather’, and deeply revere it as a savior to all living things, regardless of the role that is forced upon it, the true meaning behind it, and the idea of the process’ inevitable repeat.</p>

        <p class="quote">The premise of it is strange. Senseless, to any person of sound mind. I dared to ask them a question it seems they have received too many times, perhaps from other outsiders, or perhaps from their young. “How many times?” Oureka Asa, a member of the circle—one of the oldest among them, does not laugh. He does not smile, nor even falter from his expression before. He speaks, and the translator relays his words:
        <br>“Days and nights, how many have already passed?”
        <br>After my visit, I still do not know the truth of the matter. 
        <br>—Serill Augustine</p>
        
        <p class="passage">There is no conspicuous answer to how many cycles humankind has endured, nor how many forefathers have stood before the Apex. However, the theory is not without merit due to the various unexplainable artifacts found by scholars and researchers. Among them: ancient ruins half smothered into earth predate any current timeline, sepulchers and temples of unknown architecture lay empty and unidentifiable, and long lost landmarks with no identity found beneath the Sunlands—all without explanation. To that, the hermits posit that humankind—spanning the Three Dawns—were not the first, and that the Dancers may be a glimpse at the tragedy that consumed the past.</p>

        <p class="passage">Of the members of the circle that dedicate their lives to tracing the god, they all share a similar detail: that it presumes no body and no frame but that of two, unwavering eyes with eternities within. Eyes that, dreadfully, the many caught within the flow of life and death will never be granted the burden of being able to see.</p>
