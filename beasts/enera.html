        <p class="passage">Having a remarkable resemblance to mountainous terrain, the caldrin Enera is adorned with massive protrusions and ridges along her back, hindlegs, crest, bridge, and snout. Though once winged, her history had caused a grave injury that burned the majority of her wingspan, leaving her without connective tissue with what remained as empty, stone-like limbs. Enera also bore radiant myst-green eyes, giving her the title the Emerald Mountain. The beast is one of the earliest documented within the early age of man which has resulted in early contributions—and shaped much of humankind's understanding of beastialkind and their relation to myst, and thus humanity. Little is known about Enera's personal characteristics, much less of her bearer, but few passed tellings during her reign record attempted communications with the then infant province of Moudellin. It is not known what was discussed during this time, but it is speculated that subsequent sightings of Enera and her involvement in her battles with humankind were as a result of disagreement.</p>
        <p class="passage">Her last known host, Isopel of Moude, had fostered together a hermetic relationship after she had chosen to exile herself from her home village. Having loved a man there named Gilow, it is revealed that the separation was particularly difficult for Isopel, and that her decision of self-exilation was made as a preventative measure to protect him from the scrutiny of his involvement of her. As she would come to find, this did not alleviate nor mitigate the maltreatment her lover would incur, and would increasingly apply an indignation that she could not rid of, nor forgive. It is theorized the last of her remaining years of living was spent as a form of revenge and punishment to her oppressors and conquerers.</p>
        <p class="passage">The clearest remnants of the reign of Enera are left in a series of letters written by Isopel's lover, Gilow, whom followed in the wake of their destruction and one-sided war with the fey, and who would stand to be one of—if not, the first—advocate and martyr for the mystbound beasts.</p>

        <p class="passage">"The bestias we so feared—we so revered for so long since the birth of our days would not stop. They couldn’t stop. For all the ones that passed onto the afterlife, for all the ones that saw each of the Creator’s makings, I curse it all. It could’ve been stopped… all of it. And she could’ve been the one to do it. For those days that we had went through hell and back, the very days that we had almost been wiped numerous times… all of it was in vain.</p>
        <p class="passage">And what was I supposed to do? I did all that I could. They didn’t listen, and now they will pay the price. But I’m no better, am I? For I didn’t believe her either. She tried her best… but it was all for naught. In the end, she was the strongest [———]. What side am I truly on? Do I fight for my own kind? Am I left with nothing but the things I [———]? I’ve lost myself too far into regret… but this, I know, is my punishment.</p>
        <p class="passage">If you are reading this, do not concern yourself. Only divinity [———] already too late. I write to see my own place… nothing more. I curse us all to regret what we’ve done. For now, I set off to find her. I fear that our kind will never see the light of day. But in the end, I suppose we were all meant to cower in the shadows. This was our kind’s destiny."</p>
