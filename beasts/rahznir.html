        <p class="passage">Feared by many for his uncontrollable, irritable nature, Rahznir was a notable beast who was involved in the downfall of three kingdoms: ???, ???, and ???. Supposedly bred from another, ???, and the remnants of ???, among Rahznir's notable features is his head and crest, which take after the lineage of ???, or the "anvil-shaped" dragons which ruled alongside the ??? ones. The beast sported two pairs of massive, spiraling jagged peaks as a crest, a ridge of spikes (osteoderms) along his back, shoulders, and sides, and a distinguishable glow of firelight for an underside which is often depicted with his visage; that which emits alongside his breath, as a violent, exhaust of his rage.</p>
        <p class="passage">Rahznir is often accompanied with the idea of resistance, enslavement, and liberation. For as destructive as he was, his legacy left a precedent that even the most powerful of kingdoms fall, and though some reflect it as beastial terror, it was substantial enough to gain his most recognizable of titles: "Rise", of which none truly know if his very name takes after the word or not.</p>
        <p class="passage">Being mystbound, there is a strong historical connection to both him and his last known bearer, Galfridus the Fallen. Having particpated in many wars and battles in servitude to the kingdom of ???, and living through four generations of their bloodline, Rahznir's strength was unrivaled, yet his temper grew with his age. So much so, that eventually, he had severed his link with his bearer—though it is still unclear as to how. He is the only beast as of yet to have done this.</p>
        <p class="passage">Subsequently, the detrimental effects of being unbound drew Rahznir to an unending wrath against humanity, its kingdoms, and the very nature of myst itself. His title of "Moon Eater" originates from his documented ritual of being most active during particular phases of the moon cycle, where it is theorized he was able to absorb atmospheric myst that lingered in the air. Such events were consistent, and fall in line with scholarly studies about myst and its properties. Rahznir may have been a contributing factor to the loss of the potency of myst and its involved role within the present day.</p>
        <p class="passage">Within records, Rahznir was sometimes seen inhabiting the ruins of both ??? and ???, of which he had brought ruin to, and would challenge those of his kin, other beasts, to issues of combat.</p>
